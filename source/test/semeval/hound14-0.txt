One of Sherlock Holmes's defects - - if , indeed , one may call it a defect - - was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fullfilment .
Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature , which loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him .
Partly also from his professional caution , which urged him never to take any chances .
The result , however , was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants .
I had often suffered under it , but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness .
The great ordeal was in front of us ; at last we were about to make our final effort , and yet Holmes had said nothing , and I could only surmise what his course of action would be .
My nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and the dark , void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor once again .
Every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure .
Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired wagonette , so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation .
It was a relief to me , after that unnatural restraint , when we at last passed Frankland's house and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene of action .
We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of the avenue .
The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith , while we started to walk to Merripit House .
" Are you armed , Lestrade ? "
The little detective smiled .
" As long as I have my trousers I have a hip-pocket , and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it . "
" Good !
My friend and I are also ready for emergencies . "
" You're mighty close about this affair , Mr . Holmes .
What's the game now ? "
" A waiting game . "
" My word , it does not seem a very cheerful place , " said the detective with a shiver , glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire .
" I see the lights of a house ahead of us . "
" That is Merripit House and the end of our journey .
I must request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper . "
We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house , but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it .
" This will do , " said he .
" These rocks upon the right make an admirable screen . "
" We are to wait here ? "
" Yes , we shall make our little ambush here .
Get into this hollow , Lestrade .
You have been inside the house , have you not , Watson ?
Can you tell the position of the rooms ?
What are those latticed windows at this end ? "
" I think they are the kitchen windows . "
" And the one beyond , which shines so brightly ? "
" That is certainly the dining-room . "
" The blinds are up .
You know the lie of the land best .
Creep forward quietly and see what they are doing - - but for heaven's sake don't let them know that they are watched ! "
I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded the stunted orchard .
Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained window .
" I could look straight through the uncurtained window . "
There were only two men in the room , Sir Henry and Stapleton .
They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table .
Both of them were smoking cigars , and coffee and wine were in front of them .
Stapleton was talking with animation , but the baronet looked pale and distrait .
Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind .
As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room , while Sir Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair , puffing at his cigar .
I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon gravel .
The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall under which I crouched .
Looking over , I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in the corner of the orchard .
A key turned in a lock , and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from within .
He was only a minute or so inside , and then I heard the key turn once more and he passed me and reentered the house .
I saw him rejoin his guest , and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell them what I had seen .
" You say , Watson , that the lady is not there ? " Holmes asked when I had finished my report .
" No . "
" Where can she be , then , since there is no light in any other room except the kitchen ? "
" I cannot think where she is . "
I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense , white fog .
It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a wall on that side of us , low but thick and well defined .
The moon shone on it , and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field , with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface .
Holmes's face was turned towards it , and he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift .
" It's moving towards us , Watson . "
" Is that serious ? "
" Very serious , indeed - - the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans .
He can't be very long , now .
It is already ten o'clock .
Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out before the fog is over the path . "
The night was clear and fine above us .
