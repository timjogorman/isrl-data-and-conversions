The stars shone cold and bright , while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft , uncertain light .
Before us lay the dark bulk of the house , its serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky .
Broad bars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard and the moor .
One of them was suddenly shut off .
The servants had left the kitchen .
There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men , the murderous host and the unconscious guest , still chatted over their cigars .
Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house .
Already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window .
The farther wall of the orchard was already invisible , and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour .
As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea .
Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience .
" If he isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered .
In half an hour we won't be able to see our hands in front of us . "
" Shall we move farther back upon higher ground ? "
" Yes , I think it would be as well . "
So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house , and still that dense white sea , with the moon silvering its upper edge , swept slowly and inexorably on .
" We are going too far , " said Holmes .
" We dare not take the chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us .
At all costs we must hold our ground where we are . " He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground .
" Thank God , I think that I hear him coming . "
A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor .
Crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us .
The steps grew louder , and through the fog , as through a curtain , there stepped the man whom we were awaiting .
He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the clear , starlit night .
" He looked round him in surprise . "
Then he came swiftly along the path , passed close to where we lay , and went on up the long slope behind us .
As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder , like a man who is ill at ease .
" Hist ! " cried Holmes , and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol .
" Look out !
It's coming ! "
There was a thin , crisp , continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank .
The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay , and we glared at it , all three , uncertain what horror was about to break from the heart of it .
I was at Holmes's elbow , and I glanced for an instant at his face .
It was pale and exultant , his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight .
But suddenly they started forward in a rigid , fixed stare , and his lips parted in amazement .
At the same instant Lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground .
I sprang to my feet , my inert hand grasping my pistol , my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog .
A hound it was , an enormous coal-black hound , but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen .
Fire burst from its open mouth , its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare , its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame .
Never in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more savage , more appalling , more hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog .
" Holmes emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature's flank . "
With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track , following hard upon the footsteps of our friend .
So paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our nerve .
Then Holmes and I both fired together , and the creature gave a hideous howl , which showed that one at least had hit him .
He did not pause , however , but bounded onward .
Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back , his face white in the moonlight , his hands raised in horror , glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down .
But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the winds .
If he was vulnerable he was mortal , and if we could wound him we could kill him .
Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night .
I am reckoned fleet of foot , but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the little professional .
In front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound .
I was in time to see the beast spring upon its victim , hurl him to the ground , and worry at his throat .
But the next instant Holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature's flank .
With a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air , it rolled upon its back , four feet pawing furiously , and then fell limp upon its side .
I stooped , panting , and pressed my pistol to the dreadful , shimmering head , but it was useless to press the trigger .
The giant hound was dead .
Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen .
We tore away his collar , and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time .
Already our friend's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move .
Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet's teeth , and two frightened eyes were looking up at us .
" My God ! " he whispered .
" What was it ?
What , in heaven's name , was it ? "
" It's dead , whatever it is , " said Holmes .
" We've laid the family ghost once and forever . "
In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying stretched before us .
It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure mastiff ; but it appeared to be a combination of the two - - gaunt , savage , and as large as a small lioness .
Even now in the stillness of death , the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small , deep-set , cruel eyes were ringed with fire .
I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle , and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the darkness .
